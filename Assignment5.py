Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
2.   Extracts the first five elements from the list.
3.   Reverses these extracted elements.
4.   Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list
'''

numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
first_five = numbers[0:5]
print("Extracted first five elements: " + str(first_five))
first_five.reverse()
print("Reversed list: " + str(first_five))
